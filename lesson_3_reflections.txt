Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: You would want to use a remote repository when you are on a public computer or another computer not directly linked to your command line account. You would keep your work local when you have full access to your computer without a problem at the time you need to add something.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Its better to pull changes manually because they may change if you take a pause or if someone is contributing to the project. You don't want git to update automatically because the new additions may not be ready when you stop editing.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Forks are obtaining a copy of a repository onto your GitHub account without having access to the original to make changes. Clones are making a copy directing onto your computer without having any connection with the original. Branches are making a new "road" of changes without affecting the main content and having the option to combine later on or not. You would use forks when you want access to someone's public project on GitHub, a clone when you just want a copy of the project onto your computer or for your own and a branch when you are working on a new feature or change or working in a team with other and don't want to affect the origina content.
